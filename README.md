# credit_card_fraud_detection
detecting the fraud credit card transactions
This project is done in python 


This Python script is a detailed example demonstrating the process of importing data, performing preprocessing, and creating a decision tree model to identify fraudulent activities. Here's an overview of its functionality:

**Data Import and Preprocessing:**

- The script starts by importing the required libraries and configuring environment settings.
- It proceeds to fetch the fraud-detection dataset from a designated source and extracts it into the '/kaggle/input' directory.
- After downloading, the dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, where initial preprocessing steps are undertaken.
- It handles missing entries in numerical columns by imputing them, employing strategies such as using the median or replacing with 0 for binary variables.
- Categorical variables undergo factorization (label encoding) for numerical representation.

**Building the Decision Tree Model:**

- The data is divided into features (X) and the target variable (y).
- A split of 70-30 is used for the train-test separation.
- A decision tree classifier is then created and fitted with the training dataset.
- The model makes predictions on the test dataset.
- The script calculates and outputs the accuracy and a classification report, which includes metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

**GitHub README Description:**

To document the script on GitHub, structure the README as follows:

- **Introduction:** Offer a concise introduction to the script's goal (detecting fraud) and its key components.
- **Data Import and Preprocessing:** Detail the procedure for acquiring, decompressing, and preprocessing the data.
- **Model Building:** Describe the steps taken to construct, train, and assess the decision tree model.
- **Usage:** Highlight any special instructions or dependencies required to execute the script.
- **Example Output:** Share an instance of the results or output generated by running the script.
- **Credits and License:** Acknowledge the original creators or sources of the data and mention the applicable license, if any.

By adhering to this format, users will gain a comprehensive understanding of the script's purpose and instructions for leveraging it for their needs.
