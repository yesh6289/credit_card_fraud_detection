# credit_card_fraud_detection
detecting the fraud credit card transactions
This project is done in python 


This Python script is a detailed example demonstrating the process of importing data, performing preprocessing, and creating a decision tree model to identify fraudulent activities. Here's an overview of its functionality:

**Data Import and Preprocessing:**

- The script starts by importing the required libraries and configuring environment settings.
- It proceeds to fetch the fraud-detection dataset from a designated source and extracts it into the '/kaggle/input' directory.
- After downloading, the dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, where initial preprocessing steps are undertaken.
- It handles missing entries in numerical columns by imputing them, employing strategies such as using the median or replacing with 0 for binary variables.
- Categorical variables undergo factorization (label encoding) for numerical representation.

**Building the Decision Tree Model:**

- The data is divided into features (X) and the target variable (y).
- A split of 70-30 is used for the train-test separation.
- A decision tree classifier is then created and fitted with the training dataset.
- The model makes predictions on the test dataset.
- The script calculates and outputs the accuracy and a classification report, which includes metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

**GitHub README Description:**

To document the script on GitHub, structure the README as follows:

- **Introduction:** Offer a concise introduction to the script's goal (detecting fraud) and its key components.
- **Data Import and Preprocessing:** Detail the procedure for acquiring, decompressing, and preprocessing the data.
- **Model Building:** Describe the steps taken to construct, train, and assess the decision tree model.
- **Usage:** Highlight any special instructions or dependencies required to execute the script.
- **Example Output:** Share an instance of the results or output generated by running the script.
- **Credits and License:** Acknowledge the original creators or sources of the data and mention the applicable license, if any.

ROC curves are very useful tool for understanding the performance of binary classifiers. However, our case is a bit out of the ordinary. We have a very imbalanced dataset. Nonetheless, let's have a look at our ROC curve:

In my code I have plotted the RoC curve for better understanding of the data and to derive valuable insights such as precision and recall.
They help us to further proceed about about our model and also helps to evaluate the model, gives how well our model can perform on the test data.
